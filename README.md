## Fire Master

This tool allows you to create impressive circles of fire anywhere you want. Just aim at a spot on the floor or wall and click the tool to create a circle of fire at that spot. The Fire Master tool uses fire magic to create a spectacular and long-lasting ring of fire that extends up to 6 nodes in diameter.

Note: that the Fire Master Tool has a 60 second cooldown to prevent overuse.
